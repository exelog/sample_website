                <p>Before we talk about what a frontend developer is, let’s define the term “frontend”. The frontend (or front end) of a website is made up of the components of a website or web application that the user interacts with.

                    Also called the “client side,” the frontend of the website should be easy to read, simple to navigate, and work with the ever-changing requirements of different browsers and devices. 
                    
                    A frontend developer codes those components with languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They usually work on a team with designers and other developers to make a complete website or web application.</p>
